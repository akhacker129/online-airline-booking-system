I conducted a thorough analysis comparing both online and offline systems, examining their respective advantages and disadvantages.

I found that the online system offers several key benefits over the offline counterpart. Firstly, online booking provides users with the convenience of accessing and reserving flights from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating the need for physical presence at a ticketing office. This not only saves time but also enhances accessibility for a broader range of users.

Additionally, the online system facilitates real-time updates and availability checks, ensuring users receive accurate and up-to-date information on flight schedules, seat availability, and fares. The streamlined process allows for quick and efficient transactions, contributing to an improved overall user experience.

Furthermore, the online platform enables users to compare prices, choose from a variety of options, and make informed decisions based on transparent and readily available information. This transparency fosters a competitive environment, benefiting users with competitive pricing and enhanced choices.

In conclusion, the transition to an online airline booking system offers increased convenience, real-time information, and a more competitive marketplace, making it a preferable choice over traditional offline systems. The shift towards online solutions aligns with the evolving needs and expectations of modern users in the digital era.
